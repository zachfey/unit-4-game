# RPG Game

## To run:

Give it a shot here: https://zachfey.github.io/unit-4-game/

## Description

A bare-bones version of a Final Fantasy 7 fight! Make sure to practice on the weaker characters to build up your power before going for the Malboro! You can win with any character, just be sure to pick your opponents wisely!

## Motivation
To practice with JQuery. I wanted to make a dynamic page, and games are perfect for that.

## Results
Currently, a working version of the app is complete.

## Work Load
RPG Game is a solo project completed entirely by me.

## Challenges
Having taken classes on object-oriented programming the past, I quickly realized that the characters in the RPG are the perfect situation to implement it. However, we had not gone over constructors or classes yet, so I had to figure it out on my own! I missed the opportunity to add methods to the classes, and instead implemented them as generic functions.

## Improvements
 I would like to refactor the code and add methods to the character classes.

## Technologies used:
- JQuery
- HTML
- CSS
